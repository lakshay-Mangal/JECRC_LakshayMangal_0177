<!-- Student Eligibility Validation System -->

Description
1. Scenario Overview
You are building a Student Eligibility Validation System for a university admission portal.

Before allowing students to apply for courses, the system must validate eligibility conditions.

Different programs have different eligibility rules:

Engineering Program → Based on marks
Medical Program → Based on marks + age
Management Program → Based on marks + attendance
Key Constraints
Eligibility rules may change every academic year
Validation logic must be reusable
Core validation engine must remain unchanged
Validation logic should return true or false
This requirement demands condition-based validation, which is achieved using Predicate.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Entity Class
Student
Properties:

int StudentId
string Name
int Marks
int Age
int Attendance
This class represents student data for eligibility validation.

2.2 Predicate Definition
Predicate<Student>
Purpose:

Represents an eligibility condition
Accepts a Student object
Returns true if eligible, otherwise false
Enables flexible rule validation at runtime
2.3 Eligibility Rule Definitions
EngineeringEligibility
Rule:

Marks ≥ 60 → Eligible
MedicalEligibility
Rule:

Marks ≥ 70 AND Age ≥ 17 → Eligible
ManagementEligibility
Rule:

Marks ≥ 55 AND Attendance ≥ 75 → Eligible
3. Eligibility Engine (Core Component)
EligibilityEngine Responsibilities
Accept Student data
Accept a Predicate<Student>
Invoke predicate
Display eligibility status
